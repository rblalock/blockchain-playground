# Block Chain Prototype in Kotlin

This project is an experiment on block chain-esque concepts, written in Kotlin.  The repo 
serves two primary purposes:  (1) I'm slowly learning Kotlin and (2) I'm slowly learning 
block chain concepts, so this is a playground of sorts for me.

# WIP

Currently the app just runs a few block chain "mining" operations on boot.  Eventually,
I'll get all this API driven, etc.  See `src/main/kotlin/blockchain/app.kt`
